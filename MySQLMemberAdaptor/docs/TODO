* Figure out how to make passwords work. Currently using "!" as the default
  password, so that things don't barf, but that is probably not the right
  way to go about it. What is the Mailman equivalent of "No password", etc?

* MYSQL_MEMBER_DB_WHERE so you can specify a "WHERE x = y" on all the queries
  in the database. ???

* MYSQL_MEMBER_DB_SOCKET, to support a local socket connection to the MySQL
  server. This should be easy using the "unix_socket" attribute of MySQLdb's
  connect call.

* Ensure that what the patch is doing ties up with Barry's input wrt. what it
  should be doing.
